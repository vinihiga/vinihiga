### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Mobile Software Engineer for a multinational company and I have a bachelor on Software Engineering (PUC-Campinas), also I'm an alumni of the Apple program called Developer Academy (BEPiD).

On my free time, I like to create some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS and videogames for any type of platforms (PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...). 

Currently, I'm working on a simple 2D Game Engine made in C++, which is also available here! The Game Engine is called SEE!
