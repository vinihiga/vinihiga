### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Mobile Software Engineer for a multinational company and I have a bachelor in Software Engineering (PUC-Campinas), also alumni of the Apple program called Developer Academy (as well known as BEPiD).

On my free time, I like to create some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS and videogames for any type of platforms (PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...).
