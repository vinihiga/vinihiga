### Hi there, I'm Vini! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior iOS Software Engineer and I have bachelor degree in Software Engineering.

I worked as 3rd party developer for big companies like Johnson & Johnson + Kenvue, Anheuser-Busch Inbev and ItaÃº Unibanco.

Here is my space where I like to put new ideas and recent studies that I did during my classes or some books topics.

Feel free to ask any questions.
