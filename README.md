### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science / Sw. Engineering and specialization in Data Science & Machine Learning at PUC-Campinas. Also, I took some Master's classes in Computer Science at UNICAMP where I researched and studied Recommendation Algorithms using Deep Learning. Ah... I've worked on projects across various sectors, including Healthcare, E-Commerce, and Banking.

I am the typical Nerd that likes Math and Algorithms. So... This is my space where I share new ideas and recent studies from classes or book topics.

Feel free to ask any questions.
