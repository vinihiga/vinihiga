### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior iOS Software Engineer and I have bachelor degree in Software Engineering.

Here is my space where I like to put new ideas and recent studies that I did during my post-graduate courses or some books topics.

Feel free to ask any questions.

### ðŸ¤“ I'm currently working on ðŸ¤“ ...
- iOS Apps for @CIANDT;
- Reading some Deep Learning and Image Processing books;
- Doing some post-graduate courses (Data Science courses);
- And creating an Operating System from scratch to study how a computer hardware works by hobby.
