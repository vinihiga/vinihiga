### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Mid level iOS Software Engineer for @CI&T, also I have integrated the Open Banking system for @Itau. I'm an alumni from Apple - Developer Academy course and from PontÃ­fica Universidade CatÃ³lica de Campinas (major in Software Engineering).

On my spare time, I like to create articles and some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS & Android, robotics stuff, also videogames (e.g. PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...). 

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on ...
- iOS Apps for @Itau in Latin America.
- Android & iOS apps for an non-profit organization in my city (@projetogavepucc).

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
