### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Mobile Software Engineer for a multinational company and I'm an alumni from Apple - Developer Academy (as well known as BEPiD in Brazil).

On my spare time, I like to create some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS & Android, also videogames (e.g. PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...). 

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on ...
- iOS Apps for a giant bank in Latin America.
- iOS & Android apps for an NGO in my city (@projetogavepucc).
- Secret personal project with my friends :-)

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
