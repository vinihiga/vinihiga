### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Sr. iOS Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I also pursued Master's studies in Computer Science at UNICAMP, focusing on Graphs Theory, Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, and my research was about Recommendations Algorithms using Deep Learning.  

With experience in **Healthcare, E-Commerce, and Banking**, I've worked on diverse projects, solving complex problems with scalable and efficient solutions. Futhermore, I'm learning currently the Node.JS ecosystem.

I have a deep passion for **Mathematics, Algorithms, and System Design**. This space is where I share ideas, insights from my studies, and experiments with new technologies.
