### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as iOS Software Engineer for @Everis and @ItaÃº, also I'm an alumni from Apple - Developer Academy course and from PontÃ­fica Universidade CatÃ³lica de Campinas (major in Software Engineering).

I'm a post-graduate student at @Mackenzie and I'm focusing on the Artificial Intelligence area (specifically Deep Learning and Machine Learning).

On my spare time, I like to create some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS & Android, robotics stuff, also videogames (e.g. PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...). 

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on ...
- iOS Apps for @ItaÃº in Latin America.
- Studying Deep Learning and Machine Learning on my graduation (@Mackenzie).
- Android app for an non-profit organization in my city (@projetogavepucc).
- Personal assistant called J.A.R.V.I.S... Yes, a personal assistant that'll mimetize JARVIS from Iron Man that uses Machine Learning haha
