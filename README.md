### Hi there, I'm Vini! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Mobile Software Engineer for a multinational company (bank sector), also alumni from Apple - Developer Academy course (as well known as BEPiD in Brazil) and from PontÃ­fica Universidade CatÃ³lica de Campinas (major in Software Engineering).

I'm a graduate student at @Mackenzie - SÃ£o Paulo and I'm focusing on the Artificial Intelligence area (specifically Deep Learning and Machine Learning).

On my spare time, I like to create some Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for iOS & Android, robotics stuff, also videogames (e.g. PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Playstation, Nintendo, Xbox...). 

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on ...
- iOS Apps for a giant bank in Latin America.
- Studying Deep Learning and Machine Learning on my graduation (@Mackenzie).
- iOS & Android apps for an NGO in my city (@projetogavepucc).
- Secret personal project with my friends :-)
